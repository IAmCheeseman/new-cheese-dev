                Red Nivis is a <b>rogue-like metroidvania</b> where you explore
                the ruins of the <i>Red Nivis Laboratory</i>. Every run, you'll
                have to <i>relearn the layout of the world</i>, and you will be
                able to start with a set amount of abilities, just so long
                as you have that option unlocked.
