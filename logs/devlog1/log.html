                This devlog is here mostly just to let everyone know this project exists.

                The first boss, Hank, is finished. Hank doesn't stand for anything, really,

            <p>
                After that footage was captured, he was nerfed a bit, and given a proper
                death animation.

                Both of these videos are fairly old, so any issues you may notice are
                probably fixed.

                That's all I really have to show at the moment, there are a couple weapons
                and enemies I've added that weren't shown. If you want more frequent updates,
