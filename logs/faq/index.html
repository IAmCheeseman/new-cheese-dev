                <p>
                    No planned release date yet. Hoping for 2022/early 2023.

                <p>
                    Check out the top right (Desktop only), either Youtube or Discord are best,
                    planning on starting up with Twitter again soon.

                <h2>What software do you use?</h2>
                <p>
                    I use Godot as my engine/IDE, Aseprite for art. I use freesound.org
                    in combination with Audacity to create my sounds. No music yet, probably
                    gonna outsource that.

                <p>
                    Not at the moment. I have a Discord server, (Top right on desktop) where I have 
                    testers, but joining is not a guarantee that you get to playtest.

                <h2>Where can I buy your game when it's released?</h2>
                <p>
                    Aiming for Steam, Itch.io will probably happen too.

                <h2>Do you need help with your game?</h2>
                <p>
                    Nope! The only position I'd think about hiring for would be music, 
                    and it would be a commission, aka, I'd pay you on the spot. You 
                    won't be getting any share.
