                Hello! In this devlog I'll be announcing my Steam page. I'll also
                cover some changes I've made, and some design decisions I made.

            <h3>Steam Page</h3>
            <p>
                I've made a Steam page! You can find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928130/Red_Nivis/" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <p>
                So this month, I've made a bunch of big design decisions. I've 
                massively lowered enemy HP, so they take ~2 hits to kill. 
                This is so that it's not tedious to play the game, doing the most
                common and basic action against a single enemy forever. To counter 
                the incoming complaint about "Fights being too quick", I've increased
                the amount of enemies in a room. Weird thing about this is that
                it doesn't massively increase difficulty, although it does increase
                stress. Which is good. Another complaint I can see happening is that
                it could lead to stupid damage, this isn't true, there's always something
                someone can do to avoid damage, avoiding hits is pretty much the entire
                purpose of the melee.

            <h3>Additions & Changes</h3>
            <p>
                I've added two new weapons: Vaporgat & Bubble Gun.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Vaporgat is a shotgun that shoots an AoE with DoT.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bubble Gun is a rifle that shoots a bar of soap, which leaves bubbles behind it.
                The bubbles also do damage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both the Vaporgat and Bubble Gun are later game weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've removed The Caves, and replaced it with The Maintenance Rooms
