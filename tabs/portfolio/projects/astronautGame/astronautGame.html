                My current, in development game. At the end of this article,
                there will be links to videos showing gameplay. But first, a
                description.

                It's a roguelike metroidvania, sounds bad at first. I have systems
                to help with progress, after you unlock an ability, you can unlock
                it permenantly, after doing a challenge of some sort. When you start
                a run, you can choose a couple abilities to start with. The rest you
                will have to unlock.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I want at least 6 biomes, with 3-4 weapons in each. The final game
                will have multiple enemies to find, and NPCs. There will be 6 bosses,
                and 5 abilities.
