            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Cheeseman! I am a programmer from the US. I've been
                programming since I was ~12, starting with python, with the main 
                goal of eventually making games. I achieved that goal sometime in
                2019, when I discovered godot. I eventually dropped my first 
                project due to hard to maintain code, and scope creep. I am now
                making a new game, which is probably somewhere in the
                <a href="/tabs/devlogs/devlogs.html">Devlogs</a> section.
            </p>

            <h3>What I do</h3>
            <p>
                I am a web dev (learning) & game developer. I mainly work with
                the Godot Game Engine, when I'm doing game dev. Currently, I'm 
                making a roguelike metroidvania about an astronaut exploring
                ruins of a lab. Most of my projects are open source, on
                <a href="https://github.com/IAmCheeseman">Github</a>, including 
                this website, although it doesn't include most of my games.
                I also do pixel art, with 2k hours in Aseprite.
